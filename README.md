# TEK830 - Digitalization and AI in practice Team 6
 This is our (Team 6) project and GitHub repository for Digitalization and AI in practice, TEK830, a course at Chalmers University. Our project has the theme "How might we use smart home data to reduce utility costs in Europe?". With this theme, we then decided to do a concept of what an update to the IKEA Home Smart app could look like.
 
## Structure
This is a Java project that uses JavaFX and the H2 database engine.

### Running the project
As of right now when you launch the project through main then a window will pop up for the app. Then by pressing "P" through your keyboard a notification will popup for a few seconds and then go away.
